Hi I am Di Fang, an Associate Professor in the Food and Resource Economics Department [https://fred.ifas.ufl.edu/about/directory/di-fang/] at the University of Florida. I am an associate editor for the American Journal of Agricultural Economics [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14678276/homepage/editorial-board] and managing editor for The Agricultural and Resource Economics Review (ARER) [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/agricultural-and-resource-economics-review/information/about-this-journal/editorial-board]. I have a BS in Economics from Nankai University in China and a Ph.D. in Agribusiness from W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. My research focuses on food security and health economics. I have been published, among others, in the AJAE, Southern Economic Journal, American Journal of Public Health, and JAMA Network Open. My research has been funded by the USDA's Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF).
