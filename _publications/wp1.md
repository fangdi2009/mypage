excerpt: 'Many organizations use teamwork in the workplace. A longstanding question in economics is whether
teams should consist of heterogeneous specialists or members with similar expertise. Diversity in
specialized skills may generate productive complementarities, but it also may increase the costs of
coordination and complicate teamwork. We study this question in the context of doctor teams in the
hospital industry. Using a clean research design and novel data from Brazil, we find that teams of doctors
with greater overlap in medical expertise achieve lower patient mortality rates while reducing spending
on the length of hospital stay, tests, exams and other medical inputs. These effects are larger when
team members have less accumulated experience working together and perform more complex tasks,
consistent with an improved coordination channel. Remarkably, this relationship is not observed for
elective admissions. These findings suggest that in an emergency context, where doctor teams must make
critical decisions under considerable pressure, the coordination costs of diversity in specialized skills are
large enough to outweigh any beneficial complementarities. Counterfactual policy simulations suggest
significant efficiency gains from reallocating certain doctors across regular workdays.'
